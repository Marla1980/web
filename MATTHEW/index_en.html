  <p class="texto2">In 1962, Aldous Leonard Huxley publishes <em>Island</em>, a novel that would become his last work of fiction. A year later, November 22nd, 1963, Aldous Huxley dies at age 79 and John F. Kennedy is assassinated in Dallas. As if it was an attempt to give proof to an urban legend, in this piece I consider the possibility that Huxley, one of the greatest visionaries in the world of literature, had left a hidden message for his son Matthew amongst the pages of <em>Island</em>. A message full of prophecies and premonitions of things that Huxley wanted to tell his son, but never had the courage to confront him face-to-face. This becomes the starting point of my investigation through the almost 500 pages of the book to try and decipher what Aldous tried to tell Matthew, his son. At the same time, I read the memoirs of his wife Laura Archera Huxley and discover a statement that speaks of <em>Island</em>, and of the problems the readers encountered to accept said novel: “<em>Island</em> was difficult, its message could have been conveyed without having to have been a novel, but Aldous thought that merging his message with a story would reach a larger and more diverse audience.” Indeed, in <em>Island</em> Aldous tried to go beyond the realm of fiction, and his wife’s statements prove it. This is what makes the possibility of a hidden message between its pages so plausible. “Aldous was appalled that nobody took <em>Island</em> seriously. It was considered a science-fiction novel when it was not fiction at all, because each of the forms of life that Aldous discovered on <em>Island</em> wasn’t a product of his imagination, but something that had been implemented in one place or another, even in our own daily lives.” </p>
  <p class="texto2">Despite having written one of the classics of 20th century literature, Aldous’s personal endeavour failed because his readers did not conceive <em>Island</em> as anything more than a work of fiction. This is why, in this installation, the hidden message seems undecipherable to the spectator: 325 sheets of paper are scattered chaotically on the floor, upon which images of the assassination of John F. Kennedy are projected. An assassination that captured the full attention of mass media, which, on the other hand, had no mention of the death of Huxley.</p>
